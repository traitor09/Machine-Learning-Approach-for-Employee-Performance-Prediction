# Project Title : Machine Learning Approach for Employee Performance Prediction

## Overview
This repository implements a machine learning solution to predict employee performance using a set of key features. The project evaluates three distinct models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—and selects the best performer based on industry-standard metrics. The final model is deployed via a Flask API for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Import and analyze employee data to understand the underlying patterns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform comprehensive visualizations, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistics to gain actionable insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and engineer features to optimize model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
- **Deployment**: Integrate the best-performing model into a Flask API for immediate use.
